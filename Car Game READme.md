# Car Game
This game was my first project for my Game Programming and Design class. This game was made by **Unity** and was creating as a learning experience for myself to learn how to Design games.


# Description
In this game your objective is to ride around a neighborehood and collect **Blue** stars that are around the map. **Stay on the road** or else you will be sent back to where you started. This game is in Beta so there will be more added to this game later on.
